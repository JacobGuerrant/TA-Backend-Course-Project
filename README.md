# Travel Agency Backend
This project had me integrating an existing MySQL backend with an HTML frontend using the Spring framework. The program utilizes an external dataset supplied by the course and thus cannot be run locally. The project itself is a web application for a travel agency providing users options for booking vacations. The application populates the SQL database to handle user's carts and orders.
